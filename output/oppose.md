While AI is undoubtedly progressing rapidly, the argument for a *major breakthrough* this year is overstated. The current trajectory points towards incremental improvements and refinements of existing technologies, not a fundamental shift in AI capabilities. Large language models improve but refine existing capabilities without true understanding. Increased computational power yields diminishing returns with current algorithms, requiring novel approaches, not just scaling. Significant investment doesn't guarantee innovation, as transformative breakthroughs need the right ideas, people, and serendipity, not just funding. The definition of "major breakthrough" is subjective, and the current advancements enhance existing applications rather than creating entirely new paradigms. Therefore, anticipating a major breakthrough in AI within the next year is overly optimistic because necessary ingredients for a true breakthrough, like novel architectures and radically new learning paradigms, are not guaranteed.
